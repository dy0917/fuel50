### Further development
```
This project is built Vue2, vue-bootstrap and Typescript. It is a simple project with a dashboard page.
For further development, it needs a component structure, like the overview and top music section should be a component.

The project has Typescript, but not use it much in the current state. The good thing of TS, it is give developer a clear idea what object and attribute of this obejct is.
